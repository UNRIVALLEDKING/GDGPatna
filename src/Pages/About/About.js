                When you join a Google Developer Group, youâ€™ll have the
                opportunity to meet local developers with similar interests in
                technology. A GDG meetup event includes talks on a wide range of
                technical topics where you can learn new skills through hands-on
                workshops. The community prides itself on being an inclusive
                environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech - from
                beginner developers to experienced professionals - all are
                welcome to join.
